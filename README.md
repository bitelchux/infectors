# Infectors
Infectors is a sokoban-like game where you have to solve puzzles pushing cryogenic capsules 
toward viruses to capture them and save the earth from the invasion. At the moment the game 
comes with 21 levels.

This version is a [Phaser](http://phaser.io) port from the 
[original version](http://pygame.org/project-Infectors-567-.html) developed in [Pygame](http://pygame.org) 
in December 2007.
